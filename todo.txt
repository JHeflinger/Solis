It should be noted that in a real world application, you're not supposed to actually call vkAllocateMemory for every individual buffer. The maximum number of simultaneous memory allocations is limited by the maxMemoryAllocationCount physical device limit, which may be as low as 4096 even on high end hardware like an NVIDIA GTX 1080. The right way to allocate memory for a large number of objects at the same time is to create a custom allocator that splits up a single allocation among many different objects by using the offset parameters that we've seen in many functions.

You can either implement such an allocator yourself, or use the VulkanMemoryAllocator library provided by the GPUOpen initiative. However, for this tutorial it's okay to use a separate allocation for every resource, because we won't come close to hitting any of these limits for now.

#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

std::mutex myMutex;
int sharedVariable = 0;

void writeToVariable() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
        // Lock the mutex before writing to the shared variable
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(myMutex);
        sharedVariable++;
    }
}

void readFromVariable() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
        // Lock the mutex before reading from the shared variable
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(myMutex);
        std::cout << "Thread ID " << std::this_thread::get_id() << ": " << sharedVariable << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread thread1(writeToVariable);
    std::thread thread2(readFromVariable);

    thread1.join();
    thread2.join();

    return 0;
}
